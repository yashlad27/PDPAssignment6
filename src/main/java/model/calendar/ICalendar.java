/**
 * Interface defining the core functionality of a calendar system.
 *
 * <p>This interface provides a comprehensive API for managing calendar events, including: -
 * Creating and managing single events - Creating and managing recurring events - Querying events by
 * date or date range - Editing event properties - Checking schedule conflicts - Exporting calendar
 * data
 *
 * <p>The calendar supports two main types of events: 1. Single events: One-time events with a
 * specific start and end time 2. Recurring events: Events that repeat on specified days with
 * either: - A fixed number of occurrences - An end date
 *
 * <p>All operations that modify events include conflict checking to maintain calendar consistency
 * and prevent double-booking.
